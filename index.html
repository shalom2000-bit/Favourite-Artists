  <h1>My Top 5 Artists</h1>
  <h3>Some Context</h3>
  <p>
    A lot of people would classify me as an "Musicophile" or someone with a
    passion for music. Dancing, singing, vibing... I'm that guy. For some
    substance, my Apple Music Replay stats showed I listened to music for 67,000
    minutes. Personally, I thought it would've been higher but it is what it
    is... it's not like I'm disappointed in myself or anthing ðŸ‘€.

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>
    I will keep things simple, below you will find links of my top 5 artists.
    The link will take you to another page where you can read my full thoughts
    on the artist of topic and my top 10 songs from them.
