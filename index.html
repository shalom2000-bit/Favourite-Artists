    <h3>Some Context</h3>
    <p>
      Are you a music head? Does the bass from music get you moving? Same, I
      feel that shit in my core. A lot of people would classify me as an
      "Musicophile" or someone with a passion for music. Dancing, singing,
      vibing... I'm that guy. For some substance, my Apple Music Replay stats
      showed I listened to music for 67,000 minutes. Personally, I thought it
      would've been higher but it is what it is... it's not like I'm
      disappointed in myself or anthing ðŸ‘€.

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      I will keep things simple, below you will find links to my top 5 artists.
      The link will take you to another page where you can read my full thoughts
      on the artist of topic and my top 10 songs from them (in no order).
